  - The team had discussed whether we should use React.js as a frontend framework or use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instead. 
- Discussed how we would individually track and log our work.
  - The activity log sheet will be created using Google Sheets and team members are expected to log in their work and their hours. Thomas will create the activity log sheet.
- Discussed who should focus on which tasks for sprint 1.

## Decisions Made

- Assigned team roles based on preference. After the roles were created, members took turns picking a role that they prefer and have some background about.  
- Decided on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instead of React because such frameworks are beginner friendly for people with no background in web development.  The decision was made unanimously.
