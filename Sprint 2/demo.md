# Sprint 2 Demo Video

See the 3 videos in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gdUB1H0x6UvEIKXIdVZtgB00bw1kk-b0?usp=share_link for a full rundown of the work achieved in sprint 2.

CoreFunctionality.mov

- Showcases how an admin might perform CRUD operations on users, vehicles, and reservations. Additionally walks through how a customer might start a reservation, edit their reservation, delete their reservation, and browse vehicles for rent.

deleteVehicleOperation.mov

- Showcases a delete operation on a vehicle instance. This was missed in the previous video.

conflictingDates.mov

- Showcases how our application prevents users from reserving the same car at the same time, by blocking out dates on the calendar date picker.

pastReservationPrevention.mov

- Showcases an addition to the reservation date picker functionality, made on March 11th. Previously, reservations could be made on past dates - a flaw discovered by the team only a day before the end of the sprint. Thanks to our dedicated team and our automated, test driven development, the fix was implemented prior to submission.
